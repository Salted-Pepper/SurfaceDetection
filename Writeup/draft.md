# Abstract 

How can different search vehicles leverage agentic behaviors to maximize search effectiveness? Previous studies have either considered homogenous actors and non-agentic algorithms - or vis versa - to approach multi-period vehicle routing problems (MPVRP). We leverage new techniques - specifically Chaotic Ant Colony and voronoi tessellation - to approach the MPVRP problem. We apply this procedure in a real-world enviornment, considering Chinese ISR against U.S. ships. We find that our approach is X to Y% more effective than other methods. Substantively, this approach could offer a way to effectively allocate resources in situations that previously required large human staffs.

How can different search vehicles leverage agentic behaviors to maximize search effectiveness? 

Previous studies have either considered homogenous actors and non-agentic algorithms - or vis versa - to approach multi-period vehicle routing problems (MPVRP). 

We leverage new techniques - specifically Chaotic Ant Colony and voronoi tessellation - to approach the MPVRP problem. 

We apply this procedure in a real-world enviornment, considering Chinese ISR against U.S. ships. 

We find that our approach is X to Y% more effective than other methods. 

Substantively, this approach could offer a way to effectively allocate resources in situations that previously required large human staffs.

	abstract = {Planning maritime surveillance activities in military operations and long-term defense planning is a huge task that is done manually today. Because maritime surveillance resources are extremely expensive, the potential cost savings of using optimization models to do such planning are large. In this paper, we developed a methodology for making maritime surveillance planning more efficient. The purpose of our tool is to find routes for the force elements involved in maritime surveillance operations, where the goal is to keep a maritime picture sufficiently updated. Our problem may be viewed as a variant of the classical periodic vehicle routing problem, but it differs from this problem in some major aspects. To cope with the specific issues of our problem, we introduce a novel time-indexed formulation, where each variable is associated with a set of contiguous time periods. We defined and implemented a branch-and-price procedure to solve this formulation to exact optimality. Moreover, to tackle instances of practical size, we defined and applied efficient and effective heuristic techniques for solving the pricing problem. We show how our approach can plan up to 72-hour realistic missions with routing ships.},

	abstract = {The article presents a proposed customized genetic algorithm (CGA) to find the Pareto frontier for a bi-objective integer linear programming (ILP) model of routing in a dynamic network, where the number of nodes and edge weights vary over time. Utilizing a hybrid method, the CGA combines a genetic algorithm with dynamic programming (DP); it is a fast alternative to an ILP solver for finding efficient solutions, particularly for large dimensions. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used as a base multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Real data are used for target trajectories, from a case study of application of a surveillance boat to measure greenhouse-gas emissions of ships on the Baltic sea. The CGA’s performance is evaluated in comparison to ILP solutions in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency. Results over multiple runs indicate convergence to the efficient frontier, with a considerable computation speed-up relative to the ILP solver. The study stays as a model for hybridizing evolutionary optimization and DP methods together in solving complex real-world problems.},

	abstract = {In this study, we develop models and solution approaches for planning the surveillance mission of a homogeneous fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Predefined areas are to be observed while satisfying a minimum probability of target detection. Areas are assumed to be rectangular and discrete. UAVs with electro-optical sensors take off from a base and fly through predefined routes. The endurance of UAVs is limited by the maximum flight distance. The proposed models minimize the total travel distance of UAVs to meet the mission requirements. Each UAV starts its tour from the base and, after performing its mission over one or more areas, returns to the base. We developed a mathematical model to solve the route planning for UAVs. Since the problem is NP-Hard, we propose two constructive heuristic algorithms. In the proposed solution approach, we initially transform our problem into an m-TSP problem. Heuristic algorithms start with m-TSP solution and improve the solution to reach the best feasible one. An extensive computational study on the problems taken from the literature shows that the proposed heuristics produce efficient solutions in a reasonable time.

Dikdörtgen şeklinde ve kesikli olduğu varsayılan hedef sahalarının belirli bir hedef tespiti oranını sağlayacak şekilde taranması istenmektedir. Sensörlerle donatılmış birden çok özdeş İHA, bir üsten başlayarak hedeflere belirli bir rotada hareket eder. Her bir İHA, belirli bir maksimum uçuş menzilini geçemeyecek şekilde sınırlandırılmıştır. Problemde amaç, her İHA’lar için oluşturulan turların toplam mesafesini en küçüklemektir. Hedefteki tarama sürecinin sonlanması sonrasında rota planına uygun şekilde ya başka bir dikdörtgen sahaya giderek tura devam eder, ya da üsse giderek turunu sonlandırır. Problemin çözümü için yeni bir matematiksel model geliştirdik. Matematiksel model Np-Hard olduğu için, iki yeni sezgisel algoritma önerdik. Söz konusu problem m-TSP yapısına çevrilmiştir.

The mission is the fast identification of a target vessel. The triggering report only contains information regarding the category and displacement of a vessel carrying out a prohibited activity, resembling operational situations. A neural network trained to classify vessels is combined with vessel clustering to reduce waypoints in the flight plan. The UAV’s onboard sensors provide input for the neural network regarding each vessel in the search area, resulting in a prioritization of vessels to be visited. As the accuracy of the classification and the possibilities for clustering depend on several operational factors as well as on the UAV’s sensor degradation, we investigate three methodologies to identify which planning procedure to use in various operational situations. The results show that our robust and agile approach can help a UAV find the unknown target vessel as soon as possible.},

	abstract = {We study the use of a homogeneous fleet of drones to design an unattended persistent drone-based patrolling system for vast circular areas. The drones follow flight missions supported by auxiliary on-ground charging stations, whose location and number must be determined. To this end, we first present a mixed integer non-linear programming model for defining cyclic schedules of drone flights considering the selection of the drone model from a set of candidate drone platforms. By imposing a minimum acceptable time between consecutive visits to any perimeter point, the objective consists of minimizing the total surveillance system deployment cost. The solution provides the best platform, the location of base stations, and the number of drones needed to monitor the perimeter, as well as the flight mission for each drone. We test five commercial platforms in six different scenarios whose radios vary between 1196 and 1696 m. In five of them, the MD4-100 Microdrones model achieves the lower cost solution, with values of EUR 66,800 and 83,500 for Scenarios 1 and 2 and EUR 116,900 for Scenarios 3, 4 and 5, improving its rivals in average percentages that vary between 8.46\% and 70.40\%. In Scenario number 6, the lower cost solution is provided by the TARTOT-500 model, with a total cost of EUR 168,000, improving by 20\% the solution provided by the MD4-100. After obtaining the optimal solution, to evaluate the system robustness, we propose a discrete event simulation model incorporating uncertain flight times taking into account the possibility of accelerated depletion of drones’ Lithium-Ion polymer (Li-Po) batteries. Overall, our research investigates how various factors—such as the number of drones in the fleet and the division of the perimeter into sectors—impact the reliability of the system. Using Scenario number 3, our tests demonstrate that under a risk of battery failures of 2.5\% and three UAVs per station, the surveillance system reaches a global percentage of punctually patrolled sectors of 92.6\% and limits the number of delayed sectors (the relay UAV reaches the perimeter slightly above the required time, but it positively re-establishes the cyclic pattern for patrolling) to only a 5.6\%. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing more robust and cost-effective drone patrol systems capable of operating autonomously over large planning horizons.},

In addition to the clustering of the vessels, determined by the drone’s electro-optical sensor range, we introduce a novel technique to bias a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour. This bias is based on deliberately increasing distances to vessels that are classified as probable fishing vessels. This increase in distance is meant to prioritize visits to probable fishing vessels. Vessels are classified based on their length. The classification result and the vessel clustering are available before the actual planning of the tour. Simulations of scenarios in which we have a few vessels fishing illegally show that the novel technique, the bias-TSP, combined with a tour orientation based on operational considerations, outperforms the classic TSP: the mean distance traveled to find all the vessels involved in illegal fishing activities is reduced by at least 35–50\%. We also show that different drone take-off locations significantly impact the results.},

Within the field of multi-period VRPs, espe- cially applications with periodically recurring customer visits have been extensively studied. However, the strictly periodic VRP (PVRP) constitutes a special case of the more generic multi-period VRP (MPVRP). So far, the MPVRP in its non-periodic version has received less attention, although it arises in numerous applications, like dynamic problem settings and rich VRPs. Moreover, current literature misses a clear differentiation between MPVRP and PVRP as both terms are often used interchangeably. This paper provides a formulation for a general MPVRP and a comprehensive taxonomy for the recent literature devoted to periodic and non-periodic MPVRPs. As a field of special interest, it focuses on settings where the decisions on allowed visit periods and frequency are explicitly considered in the objective function.},

	abstract = {In this paper we deal with a practical problem that arises in military mission planning. The problem is to plan a path for one, or more, agents to reach a target without being detected by enemy sensors. Agents are not passive, rather they can initiate actions which aid evasion. They can knockout sensors. Here to knockout a sensor means to completely disable the sensor. They can also confuse sensors. Here to confuse a sensor means to reduce the probability that the sensor can detect an agent. Agent actions are path dependent and time limited. By path dependent we mean that an agent needs to be sufficiently close to a sensor to knock it out. By time limited we mean that a limit is imposed on how long a sensor is knocked out or confused before it reverts back to its original operating state. The approach adopted breaks the continuous space in which agents move into a discrete space. This enables the problem to be formulated as a zero–one integer program with linear constraints. The advantage of representing the problem in this manner is that powerful commercial software optimisation packages exist to solve the problem to proven global optimality. A heuristic for the problem based on successive shortest paths is also presented. Computational results are presented for a number of randomly generated test problems that are made publicly available.},

The goal is to design the algorithm with the fastest execution speed in order to find the path with the lowest travelling cost. In particular, new generative AI technology is continually emerging. The question of how to exploit algorithms from this realm to perform TSP path planning, especially in dynamic environments, is an important and interesting problem. The TSP application scenario investigated by this paper is that of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that needs to patrol all specific ship-targets on the sea surface before returning to its origin. Hence, during the flight, we must consider real-time changes in wind velocity and direction, as well as the dynamic addition or removal of ship targets due to mission requirements. Specifically, we implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model based on the Transformer architecture, which is widely used in Generative AI, to solve the TSP path-planning problem in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct numerous simulation experiments to compare the performance of our DRL model and the traditional heuristic algorithm, the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, in terms of operation time and path distance in solving the ordinary TSP, to verify the advantages of our model. Notably, traditional heuristic algorithms cannot be applied to dynamic environments, in which wind velocity and direction can change at any time.},

	abstract = {Real-time vessel detection in maritime environments is crucial for diverse applications requiring speed and accuracy. Static camera views often introduce blind spots, compromising detection efficiency. This paper proposes a novel, real-time UAV-based system that uses a dynamic camera control strategy to address this limitation. This strategy leverages pre-defined search patterns, historical data (if available), and real-time sensor information (e.g., radar or LiDAR) to dynamically adjust the UAV's camera gimbal angles. This ensures comprehensive search area coverage while minimizing the risk of undetected vessels. Beyond dynamic camera control, our system incorporates a unique feature-based prioritization scheme for real-time target vessel identification. This scheme analyzes features extracted from captured images, including object size and shape. Additionally, movement analysis helps distinguish stationary objects from potential vessels. The combined approach of dynamic camera control and feature-based prioritization offers significant advantages. Firstly, it enhances search efficiency by systematically scanning the area and prioritizing promising candidates based on dynamic camera adjustments and feature analysis. Secondly, it improves detection accuracy by employing feature similarity (cosine similarity with a reference vessel stored in the system using a ResNet50 module) to reduce false positives and expedite target identification, especially in scenarios with multiple vessels. A comprehensive evaluation process has been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed system in diverse simulated and real-world environments encompassing various conditions (weather, traffic density, background clutter). The results from this evaluation are highly promising and suggest the system's strong potential for real-time vessel detection in maritime environments.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in various military and civilian applications. UAV mission scheduling is a key issue in UAV applications and a central topic in UAV research. UAV task scheduling should include several constraints into consideration, such as completion time constraint, flight distance constraint, and resource consumption constraint. Furthermore, UAV task scheduling should be studied within the traditional framework of combinatorial optimisation. In this paper, we consider optimal mission scheduling for heterogeneous UAVs with completion time, flight distance, and resource consumption constraints. The contributions of the paper are summarised as follows. We define two combinatorial optimisation problems, namely, the NFTM (number of finished tasks maximisation) problem and the RFTM (reward of finished tasks maximisation) problem. We construct an algorithmic framework for both NFTM and RFTM problems, so that our heuristic algorithms (four for NFTM and two for RFTM) can be presented in a unified way. We derive upper bounds for optimal solutions, so that our heuristic solutions can be compared with optimal solutions. We experimentally evaluate the performance of our heuristic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper studying UAV mission scheduling with time, distance, and resource constraints as combinatorial optimisation problems.},
